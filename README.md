Introduction

My first Django application from scratch. Utilizes several packages and modules to present a custom homepage, complete with up-to-date weather information, news articles, and a picture from the Hubble Space Telescope (cause, you know... space!). Accepting suggestions/pull requests/etc. for further learning and project improvement.
